# Breed&longevity prediction using Python

This is my approach on prediction a dog's breed and longevity given some features like weight, height, sex, energy level etc.I used Python 3.6 and some python modules for plotting,statistics and ML algorithms.

Alongside my code you can find an analysis of the problem and approaches which I've tried.You can use my ideas to solve the same problem or similar ones.I recommend a more in depth analysis if you want better results(try more hyperparameters, more complex plots which can show you more properties of your data) and a bigger dataset.

## Packages used

Pandas, Numpy, Sklearn, Matplotlib

## Task 1 - predicting dog's breed

It is a comparison between Logistic regression, KNN and Random Forests(using algorithms form sklearn).

## Task 2 - predicting dog's longevity

It is a comparison between Linear regression and KNN Regression
